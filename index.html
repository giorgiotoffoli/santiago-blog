				<h1 class="step step-left">Step 1 - Consider</h1>
				<p class="text text-left">
					Answer this question: What is your number one goal in life? It could
					be to have a beautiful family, grow rich, become famous, help the
					world. Whatever it may be, this question can only be answered by
					<span class="i">you</span>. It is only after answering this question
					that you can begin your journey.

			</div>
			<!-- Step 2 -->
			<div>
				<h1 class="step step-right">Step 2 - Plan</h1>
				<p class="text text-right">
					After you've figured out what you want to achieve—it's time to
					actually do it. Firstly, have a plan. If you want to become a doctor
					and save lives, then know what you're going to have to do: study, get
					into college as a pre-med, go to medical school, etc. Having a plan
					with both short-term and long-term goals makes it
					<span class="i">tremendously</span> more likely that you're going to
					succeed.

			</div>
			<!-- Step 3 -->
			<div>
				<h1 class="step step-left">Step 3 - Work</h1>
				<p class="text text-left">
					Here comes the hard part: doing the hard work. Following your dreams
					is hard... <span class="i">very</span> hard. This is the reason why
					many people fail—it's simply <span class="i">too difficult</span>. So
					if you really want to achieve your dreams—do what most can't—then
					you've got to be able to get through the 'dip' in your journey. Only
					then can dreams arise.

			</div>
			<!-- Step 4 -->
			<div>
				<h1 class="step step-right">Step 4 - Motivation</h1>
				<p class="text text-right">
					There will be a point in your journey where you just want to give up.
					You'll feel burned out, your very own dream will
					<span class="i"> disgust you</span>. This is an inevitable thing...
					and also the reason for why you need motivation. How do you get it?
					Well, the answer is right in your head:
					<span class="i">visualization</span>. Imagine what it will look like
					when you finally achieve your Personal Legend. How you'll feel, how
					your life will have changed. That's how you find your path again.

			<!-- Step 5 -->
			<div>
				<h1 class="step step-left">Step 5 - Achievement</h1>
				<p class="text text-left whitespace">
					This is it. You've finally achieved your Personal Legend. You've
					completed your goal and done something that most people can't... but
					now what? It's easy to feel lost at this point. This is why you have
					to come up with smaller goals you can always look forward to, but make
					sure not to make them too big. Creating bigger, unachievable goals
					will lead to you being dissatisfied once again. Remember,
					<span class="i">you've done it</span>, now enjoy the fruits of your
					labor.
